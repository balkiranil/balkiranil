Looking for lifetime opportunities and experiences to improve myself as an Astronautical Engineer continuously

##### üë®‚ÄçüéìUndergraduate Studiesüë®‚Äçüéì

<p>‚ö°Attitude determination and control‚ö°</p>
-Simulation of the low earth orbit satellite's attitude dynamics
-Quaternion attitude representation for small satellite transformed from Euler angles
-Modified Rodrigues parameters representation for small satellite using quaternions
-Investigation of the sun direction vector in ECI frame
-Modeling of the sun sensor measurement in satellite body frame
-Earth's magnetic field vector through the orbit of the satellite using the dipole model
-Simulation of magnetometer measurements
-Passive magnetic stabilization
-Orbit lifetime analyze
-6U CubeSat 3-axes active control with reaction wheels and magnetorquer

‚ö°Compressible Aerodynamics‚ö°
-Determine the direction of the slip line and slip angle by using MATLAB code for the nozzle
-Nozzle design
-Supersonic and hypersonic flows
-CFD Analysis of 2D Airfoil

‚ö°Space Environment‚ö°
-The interplanetary environment (It observes the interplanetary environment by taking data of instruments of spacecraft is named ACE that is located at the L1 position, from NASA official website and analyzing by using statistical methods)
-The effect of magnetopause and bow shock (It observes relationships between Magnetosphere, Magnetosheath, and Solar Wind regions. Furthermore, it was observed how the Magnetopause and Bow shock separating these regions respectively caused sudden changes in some parameters)
-The magnetopause motion (It aims to examine the effect of variable dynamic pressure and Earth's magnetic field on the magnetopause, based on magnetosheath region‚Äôs data from the Themis B spacecraft)
-Magnetic storm and consequences on neutral atmosphere (magnetic storms, magnetospheric sub-storms, and magnetic indices. Using the magnetic index data, the presence of storms and sub-storms will be determined and these will be associated with the solar wind plasma and IMF data from the WIND spacecraft at the L1 position)
-Research of solar wind and solar activity (heliopause, Lagrangian points)
-Research of solar activity, earth's geomagnetic field, magnetosphere
-Research of ionosphere, radio propagation
-Research of neutral atmosphere, solar and atmospheric radiation

‚ö°Experimental Engineering‚ö°
-Boundary layer experiment
-Flow around cylinder experiment
-Electrical experiment
-Structural and materials experiment

‚ö°Spacecraft Communications‚ö°
-Link budget of the spacecraft
